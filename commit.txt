    Fix the display of 'None' in the Volumes table                    
    
    The 'Attached To' column in the Volumes table was inconsistent with
    the rest of the columns in that it did not display anything when a  
    particular volume was not attached to any instances.

    This change results in displaying the status of 'None' on the 
    'Attached To' column as a dash[-].

    The status is 'None' when a particular volume is not attached to any
    instance.
